# demo-github-repo
a repo used to check and familiarize myself w/ github's commands like push, clone, add, commit, etc. 

# second commit

checking add, commit and push origin (push origin master somehow not working), and adding an html file. if this works, after this I will create a new repo thru vscode and push that to github
